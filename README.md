# MegaDesk-Petersen
This application grabs info from the user and produces a quote for how much a desk would cost them. There is also a way to see the last quote given. Used this project to first learn how to use C#. Created and run in Visual Studio. The current version of .netcore in the project is ".netcore 4.8".

## Future plans
  - Create a way to search for a specific previous quote given. 
  - Fix the tabbing between inputs to follow the work flow
  - Update visuals to be more pleasing
